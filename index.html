<h3>About</h3>
	<p>&emsp; I'm a Sophomore at Gems World Academy Chicago and this is my current website. This space will mostly focus on academia projects and experiances, but my other interests include cross-country, watching weekly films, and Smash Bros. when I have the time. School takes up most of my schedule, but I also babysit afterschool and on weekends ages 3+. Feel free to contact me with any inquiries.</p>

<p>&emsp; For this challenge we were tasked with researching, defining, and creating a solution to an issue related to one of the Global Grande Challenges. Our team looked at Hong Kong's unstable and unlivable housing market and some angles of housing that we could take to solve that.

<p>&emsp; In this project we individually designed a solution for a problem using biomimicry. My project looked at similarities between bee hive traffic control and ours, and how some of their designs could be implemented in our urban systems.
